# ZK Proof Packer

Size ZK proof bytes, public inputs, and instructions before building a v1 transaction.

## Why this exists

Solana transaction v1 raises the maximum transaction size from 1,232 to 4,096 bytes. ZK Proof Packer explores a focused consumer use of that space while making the wire budget visible.

## Working features

- Responsive monochrome product UI with deterministic payload generation
- Live UTF-8 byte meter, v1 fit estimate, and legacy transaction comparison
- Wallet Standard discovery and v1 capability reporting
- Copy and download flows with no server, account, analytics, or custody
- Dependency-free production build and Cloudflare Workers static configuration
- Product contract test, security headers, security policy, and architecture docs

## Status

This is a functional product prototype, not an audited transaction broadcaster. It intentionally stops at payload generation so users cannot mistake experimental sizing logic for a reviewed signing flow. Integrate the generated artifact with [First](https://github.com/nirholas/first-onchain) or a reviewed `@solana/kit >= 8` v1 sender.

## Run

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:4173. To deploy after authenticating Wrangler, run `npm run deploy`.

## Transaction v1 rules

- Use transaction version 1 to access the 4,096-byte ceiling.
- Set compute-unit and loaded-accounts-data-size limits explicitly; v1 defaults both to zero.
- Check `supportedTransactionVersions.has(1)` before asking a wallet to sign.
- Readers must set `maxSupportedTransactionVersion: 1`.
- Read sponsor and indexer limits from `transactionConfig`, not Compute Budget instructions.
- V1 supports 64 inline addresses, rejects duplicates, and does not use address lookup tables.
